
Crack The Code v1.0
-------------------

This program solves logic puzzles by using given hints to crack the lock's
code. The user may design a puzzle for the program to solve by providing 
the hints, or the program can create its own puzzle/hints.

* The "Generate" button will auto-generate a randomized puzzle that the 
  user can try to solve. 
  The answer can be revealed by clicking on the "Solve" button. 

* The "Reset" button will reset the hints to their initial default values. 

* The "Solve" button will solve the puzzle and display the answer.
  If the puzzle cannot be solved, it will display an error message. 
  There are two cases where the program is unable to solve the puzzle: 
  1- If the hints provided are not enough to conclude a solution.
  2- If the hints provided are contradictory and makes no sense. 

Users can use the editing tools to design their own puzzles....

* The "+" button adds a new line.

* The "-" subtracts a line. 

* The user can navigate through the slots using arrow keys or the mouse
  to enter a number.

* The user can change a hint box by clicking on it. 

Please note that the answer must not contain repeated numbers. Otherwise
it will be an error.
